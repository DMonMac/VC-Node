## **[![Node]("Node")](https://nodejs.org/en/) VIVIXX CHALLENGES: ToDoListAPI**

### THE CHALLENGE
> Build Node.js RESTful APIs as demonstrated in this [tutorial](https://www.codementor.io/olatundegaruba/nodejs-restful-apis-in-10-minutes-q0sgsfhbd)

### RUN API
1. Install [Node.js, npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node), and [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
2. Copy the 'ToDoListAPI' folder to your computer.
3. In your terminal, set your directory to inside that folder.
4. Type `sudo service mongod start`
5. Type `npm start`.
6. Open http://localhost:3000/tasks in your browser.

### API
Basically, this deals with how to handle data requests and responses with a JSON data format, using the Representational State Transfer (REST) approach. That means HTTP requests will be used to perform four operations termed as CRUD (C: create, R: read, U: update, and D: delete). Create and/or update is used to post data, get for reading/listing data, and delete to remove data.

### POSTMAN
For this API, you'll need [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to test it out. Here's the [link](https://www.codementor.io/olatundegaruba/nodejs-restful-apis-in-10-minutes-q0sgsfhbd) for the tutorial again if you need it. It also gives details instructions on how to use Postman, but I'll just write down the methods I've tried here:

- #### ROUTES
    Do take time to look at 'ToDoListAPI/api/routes/todoListRoutes.js'. There are 2 routes set there, along with the methods they can do. When we add '/tasks' to the root URL, GET and POST functions are available, and for '/tasks/:taskId', we have GET, PUT, and DELETE.
.
- #### GET
    Once youve got Postman fired up, look for the tab that says 'GET'. To the right of that tab paste the url of the API (which in this case is http://localhost:3000/tasks). After that, click the 'Send' button to the right of the URL field. If you've been following the [tutorial](https://www.codementor.io/olatundegaruba/nodejs-restful-apis-in-10-minutes-q0sgsfhbd), it should initially return a blank array. If you used the one here, there should be at least one data entry showing up.

- #### POST
    If you look at the keys you saw when you tested GET, they're similar to the ones in the 'ToDoListAPI/api/models/todoListModel.js' file. Take note of the keys, because we'll need them to post a new data entry to the database.

    Change the GET tab to POST. Keep the URL the same since it's the same URL that accepts a POST function. Just below the URL field, click on the 'Body' tab. You should see radio buttons right below it. Select “x-www-form-urlencoded.”

    There should also a table with the headers Key, Value, and Description. The key is any of the parameters seen in todoListModel.js (name, Created_date, status). the name key is required, so type its value in the 'Value' row. Status will only accept values from the enum array. If you set values for multiple keys simultaneously, they will be set to one object only.

    If done correctly, the objects you added in the POST function should be displayed if you change the function to GET and keep the URL.

- #### DELETE
    Notice that the objects have a taskId property. If you try the GET function for http://localhost:3000/tasks/:taskId and replace ':taskId' with the value of the object's taskId, it should display the properties of that object only. By that logic, if you change the function to DELETE and send it, the object should be removed. So, if you try GET again, it should return 'null'

So that's my take on some of Postman's functions.
